# javaee-proj

Here's the project i made when I was learning Java EE.
The standard stack was used here: Java EE, Servlets and JDBC with MySQL(MariaDB).

# Screenshots

Screenshot after I added CSS (Not very impressive but still):

And that's how it looked before CSS:

# Running

To run it you must have MySQL and Tomcat installed (and in pom.xml, change the directory to which you want to upload .war fire)
After that build and deploy with maven.
